## Intro
Machine Learning Model using:

+ Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm
+ Least Squares - Support Vector Machine

using financial technical indicators:

+ Relative Strength Index (RSI)
+ Money Flow Index (MFI)
+ Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
+ Stochastic Oscillator (SO)
+ Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD)

PSO interated as a global optimization algorithm to optomize LS-SVM for stock price prediction.
